# QSBVS
Overview
This Python script generates a unitary matrix, where the elements of the first row are explicitly assigned to user-specified values. The program is designed for applications that require custom unitary matrices in quantum computing, linear algebra, or related fields.

Features
Creates an 
𝑛×𝑛 unitary matrix.
Ensures the first row elements match the user-provided numerical inputs.
Automatically adjusts other matrix elements to satisfy the unitary condition (
𝑈†𝑈=𝐼U †U=I).
