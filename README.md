# Generate Unitary Matrix with Prescribed First Row

## Overview
This Python script generates a **unitary matrix**, where the elements of the first row are explicitly assigned to user-specified values. The program is designed for applications that require custom unitary matrices in quantum computing, linear algebra, or related fields.

---

## Features
- Creates an \( n \times n \) unitary matrix.
- Ensures the **first row elements** match the user-provided numerical inputs.
- Automatically adjusts other matrix elements to satisfy the unitary condition (\( U^\dagger U = I \)).

## Usage

### Dependencies
Ensure the following Python packages are installed:
- `numpy`

To install dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install numpy
